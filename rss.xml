                            my users?" - I'm an engineer at an analytics company, and upon getting asked that question I

        <description>Some months ago I found myself with the following issue in my sprint priorities: "BigQuery
                            is very flakey on local / self-hosted" - Keeping context to a minimum, we run an open source
                            analytics platform that you can self-host, and there are plugins to help you send data out

        <description>Many years ago I received a letter that, among other things, provided me with some advice.
                            Part of that advice was: "Drink less coffee [...] and read some fiction" - The writer was
                            someone acutely aware of my approach to life, and my constant struggle to "turn off"...</description>

        <description>This will be a short one. Just a quick lil' rant. Heroku is a great platform for starting
                            out a project. You can get up and running quickly, and it's extremely easy to add in
                            valuable services (via Heroku add-ons) as well as scaling up and down...</description>

        <description>Some time ago, on a reasonably challenging 5-day trail in the Pyrenees, my group encountered
                            a dilemma. During the first 3 days of walking, our GPS devices and maps had all been showing

        <description>About a month ago I ticked off the top item on my "European Countries I'd Still Like To
                            Visit" list: Andorra. The little mountainous country squeezed between Spain and France was
                            staring at me every time I opened a map of Europe, so when a work trip took me back to the

        <description>I saw a tweet the other day that said YCombinator "dominates the product analytics
                            category". This is indeed true. YC has invested in all the top players in the product

        <description>The website you're currently on was built using a static site generator called Teeny. Until
                            yesterday, Teeny wasn't even an idea. It didn't exist at all, not even in my mind. You see,

                            was day 3 up in the Andorran Pyrenees. I started off this journey by myself (which, and this
                            is relevant, is also how I'd end up finishing it), but since day 2 I'd been hiking with 3
